## Usage
*From [gladys-google](https://github.com/GladysAssistant/gladys-google#usage)*

I recommend to sync your calendars a first time with either a script, or by clicking on the "configuration" button
(Clicking on "configuration" simply start a sync).

Then, you can create a cron schedule telling "Every 30 minutes" => sync in Gladys.

- First, create an alarm in "Alarms". Create a cron rule with the following rule : "0 0,30 * * * *".
- Then create a scenario with this alarm selected, and put in action "Sync calendars".

If the action does not exist, go to parameters and update Gladys data.
